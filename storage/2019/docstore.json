BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cRides Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants (\u201cRestaurant(s)\u201d) and food delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation and delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s)\u201d. We also connect consumers with public transportation networks, e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility options. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. We are also developing technologies that will provide autonomous driving vehicle solutions to consumers, networks of vertical take-off and landing vehicles and new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is available in 69 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9959, "end_char_idx": 12469, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63d96959-12d6-47df-a62a-b0642c525b93": {"__data__": {"id_": "63d96959-12d6-47df-a62a-b0642c525b93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db409797-f1d5-4a71-88e9-fae3993ed672", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "815c510f1e9ad1089e10fa3e19aaea4109d14bfcdacb4dc2868ffd9a08f3bd82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43de86af-882b-46d2-a2a4-9e5f326b4f34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2efea362a1757265db19c00c7f40d4c0ecf559e36efb12f55fdf2277c9cfd49f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s)\u201d.

Rides, Eats, Freight and Other Bets platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.\n\nRides\n\nRides refers to products that connect consumers with Rides Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Rides Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11633, "end_char_idx": 14109, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43de86af-882b-46d2-a2a4-9e5f326b4f34": {"__data__": {"id_": "43de86af-882b-46d2-a2a4-9e5f326b4f34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63d96959-12d6-47df-a62a-b0642c525b93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "bcec0c0b6cec3a1b9922517c1165ca9e160020b2c76ff32abdbb32fde5b6fac6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb5e8f0c-66a1-4509-9f56-84b1a4001910", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "153478ceb6f79879649078d31ccc089a05746266e4b55cd6e5a19ce4d76f88ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nEats\n\nOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand\n\nplatform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery.

Along the way to a potential future autonomous vehicle world, we believe that there will be a long period of hybrid autonomy, in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand. As we solve specific autonomous use cases, we will deploy autonomous vehicles against them. Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather. In other situations, such as those that involve substantial traffic, complex routes, or unusual weather conditions, we will continue to rely on Drivers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be uniquely suited for this dynamic phase during the expected long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles. Drivers are therefore a critical and differentiating advantage for us and will continue to be an advantage in the long term. We plan to continue to partner with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), other suppliers, such as Toyota and DENSO, and other technology companies to determine how to most effectively leverage our network during the transition to autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nPlatform Synergies\n\nOur Platform\n\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.

Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. AB5 went into effect in January 2020.\n\nAB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but the new law does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. A similar ABC test was adopted more than 10 years ago in Massachusetts.\n\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of AB5 on our business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 304795, "end_char_idx": 306915, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98183f5f-afbd-4b0a-9c4f-e9e1247e77c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "98183f5f-afbd-4b0a-9c4f-e9e1247e77c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30871cdf-c5ec-44f7-86bc-39ebd3cb52d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "1d0e33308a286335c2399164816bb253e7b75eb95544b6b27bd0a5066cb380e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "039a26f3-edea-44bd-b012-a370464328cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7cb32399533810530af292ca0aab582f85798c9931ada63c266a37085e3f722", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

For more information about how we use these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\n\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Rides or New Mobility ride or received an Eats meal on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\n\n51\n\nmapcs-q42019.jpg\n\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Rides or New Mobility rides and Eats meal deliveries in a given period. For example, an UberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n\ntrips-q42019.jpg\n\nGross Bookings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 308990, "end_char_idx": 311277, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f54fafe6-d817-46fc-ad2e-c7c5fe45aaee": {"__data__": {"id_": "f54fafe6-d817-46fc-ad2e-c7c5fe45aaee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "60db6ae9-fc64-4ee0-895b-0c699eb9068b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "d2887f769a96ce1cd6a46245221b63a2cca6cc5fb22da9fc7d5bc0689b07b499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d618bb2-ab48-4c6f-be2d-300aec7cf55d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca4e3a1a8b3e630666e91856e345bcc28ae03df2740332349c3a18082ea5b954", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC.

Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers.

The increase was also due to realized impacts on foreign exchange resulting from the settlement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities.\n\nGain on divestitures increased by $3.2 billion from 2017 to 2018. This increase was due to gains on the divestitures of our Russia/CIS and Southeast Asia operations.\n\nUnrealized gain on investments increased by $2.0 billion from 2017 to 2018.

These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our\n\n71\n\nstock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\n\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of the Convertible Notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d).

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the ongoing impact of the Tax Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility. The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $166 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 401621, "end_char_idx": 404125, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a6d9381-accb-441a-a6b4-feb2bb769721": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a6d9381-accb-441a-a6b4-feb2bb769721", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06898136-2013-405d-959a-d6ac5ab31b83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "22d15db709caaf25c52a14eec29772f1bc70e49ba05ff866306bfcd53aa73fd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c99d896-9fa3-4da0-bc2f-af6a21f748b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecea9ba83f603204b63fd02e2ba264d390f26b074f5b5825b792113cf221100b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 427666, "end_char_idx": 430385, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6cc4f7b-dd8f-4bfd-96b4-9dd0c4dc5eb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6cc4f7b-dd8f-4bfd-96b4-9dd0c4dc5eb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e2427f88922a3513f8867d4523032dc90147b8b4b362d60426bc5e802d18e015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30527d45-955a-49e6-abcb-b20c0985aa34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "75296fbf762855828f7f4617b43a9f9ac9476f070daa95557823ef73b6f6b6b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8b21510-d364-4ce8-b9a3-692e4268d1f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15158bc131d7b4017cd56c828117de622e1f131a0c25612b9e4be242e627c775", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above.
